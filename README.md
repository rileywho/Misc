# Cinema 4D Resources

Cinema 4d is a great tool. Challenging but fun to use. I would recommend following/copying some basic tutorials. After you got the hang of the basics, storyboard a bigger concept and break it down into smaller pieces. Then try to execute on the concept one piece at a time. You have to be careful about just copying other peoples work via tutorials or overwhelming yourself. 3d is tough.
